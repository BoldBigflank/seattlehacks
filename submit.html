<h2>Submitting a Post</h2>
<p>Submitting a post is as simple as sending a pull request:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Fork this repo</li>
	<li>Compose your post using Markdown syntax</li>
	<li>Name the file YYYY-MM-DD-title.md and copy to _posts directory</li>
	<li>Submit a pull request for this new file</li>
</ol>
<p>Please make sure you include a YAML header at the top of the file that defines the <code>title</code> or your post and specifies the <code>post</code> layout.</p>

<h2>Submitting an Event</h2>
<p>Submitting an event is just like submitting a post. Follow the instructions above and you're 90% of the way there. Consider the content of the post to both be an announcement of your event and the core information that people need to know to find your event.</p>
<p>The only difference is that in order for your event to make it into our <a href="/calendar">calendar</a> you need to define some additional tags. All of these tags are required:</p>
